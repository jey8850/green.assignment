    <h1>Lemon cake recipe</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2>This moist Lemon Cake Recipe is fluffy, tangy and so easy to make from scratch!</h2>
        <li>You can also make this recipe in a bundt pan. It looks prettier than in a loaf pan but make sure to grease your bundt pan generously so that your cake will come out of the pan.</li>
        <li>Don’t leave out the lemon zest, that is what gives it the wonderful lemony flavor! I always use organic lemons and my favorite grater that I’ll like below.</li>
        <li>For the best flavor use freshly squeezed lemon juice! Don’t use the bottled stuff, trust me fresh lemon juice tastes so much better.
        </li>
        <li>When you make the lemon glaze for this pound cake don’t add too much liquid. You want the glaze to be nice and thick not runny. Start with 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tbsp milk and add the remaining 1/2 tbsp as needed.
        </li>
        <li>This cake keeps well covered at room temperature for up to 4 days.
